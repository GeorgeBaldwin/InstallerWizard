This is an amazing application, many have been pleased with the results, and naturally those that benefit the most are those that enjoy many cups of coffee throughout the day such as the assistant to the assistant of the President of the Coffee Club who states

> Before, it was never really possible to
> enjoy a really good cup of coffee at the

> get things done while at the same time
> enjoying a bold cup of coffee without those
> guilty feelings of being unproductive.

```vb
Global $ApplicationList[15] = [ "Base Dev Tools" _
				, "AQT 10.2" _
				, "Visual Studio 2017" _
				, "Ruby DevKit 2.0+" _
				, "ADDS NEW ITEM HERE" _
			      ]
					          
Func StartInstallation()
   ...
	Switch $SoftwareItem
            ...
	    Case "ADDS NEW ITEM HERE"
		INSTALLADDNEWITEMHERE()
		...
	    ...
	End Switch
End Function
```
